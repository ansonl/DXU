# DXU - Dual Extrusion Upgrade for Ultimaker Original+ and Ultimaker 2+

## Improved/Updated DXU resources are in the `DXU improvements` folder. 

1. Dock adapted for UMO+ frame
2. Heater clamps with 1mm thin jaws. The linked Taobao seller sells a quality all metal hotend but the heatsink flanges are only 1mm vs 2mm apart. The seller says he can do a special order of heatsinks with 2mm flange spacing with a minimum order quantity of 50. 
3. Cura profile with calibration and improvements for DXU UMO+ are merged into Cura. 
4. [Marlin 2 firmware for DXU](https://github.com/ansonl/Marlin-DXU)

## Marlin 2.1.2 currently breaks tool changes for DXU due to nozzle wipe-on-change issue [Marlin#25117](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/issues/25117)! Please see issue linked for info and possible fixes. 

### Marlin 2 configuration directions:

- DXU functionality is possible in Marlin 2 with the code updates in Marlin [PR#24553](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/pull/24553)
  - *Please support the PR for inclusion into the main Marlin 2 code by commenting on the PR.*
  - Latest Marlin 2 firmware compatible with DXU is at [ansonl/Marlin-DXU](https://github.com/ansonl/Marlin-DXU)
    - You must manually determine second extruder X/Y/Z offset in `Marlin/Configuration.h` before compiling firmware. 
      - Compile the firmware and manually run toolchange Gcode via serial connection (T0->T1 `EVENT_GCODE_TOOLCHANGE_T1` /T1->T0 `EVENT_GCODE_TOOLCHANGE_T0`) to determine if any offsets need adjusting
      - Add the second extruder offsets to the bare T1->T0 toolchange gcode tested while T0 is the active extruder to get the offset Gcode to put into `Configuration_adv.h`.
      - **Note: The toolchange Gcode is run in the "offset context" of the target extruder!**
      - Determine second extruder Z offset by manually adjusting Z position while `T0` is selected in firmware and `T1` is physically active.
