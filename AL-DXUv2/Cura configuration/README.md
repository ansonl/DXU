# Cura Profile Installation

1. Download the latest Cura profile `*.zip` file in this directory.
2. Unzip the archive keeping the files within the respective `definitions`, `extruders`, `variants` folders.
3. Move the folders to the Cura configuration directory `%HOME%/AppData/Roaming/cura/XXX/` where `XXX` is the Cura version number. This will merge the unzipped folders' contents with the existing Cura profile folders' contents.
4. Close and restart Cura.
5. Add the DXUv2 printer as a non-networked printer. DXUv2 printers will be listed under the DXU category.
