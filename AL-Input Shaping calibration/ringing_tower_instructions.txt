Slice and run ringing_tower.stl model on your printer.
- Slice in vase/spiralize mode. Do not rotate.
- Set high acceleration and speed to show ringing. 
- Change input shaping frequency on each layer with M593. 
- https://marlinfw.org/docs/gcode/M593.html

See which height produces the best results and set the best frequencies. https://www.th3dstudio.com/marlin-input-shaping-calculator/

Premade gcode is created for Ultimaker Original+ size printer with UM2+ upgrades and should work for UM2+. 
- Uses 100mm/s and 10000mm/s^2 for speed and acceleration.
- Uses 220C for nozzle.

For before/after comparison, print the "no_IS" version of the ringing_tower gcode to test the entire ringing tower model at your firmware's set input shaping settings without any change with M593 at each layer. 

My UMO+ with original DXU design input shaping settings:
X freq 45hz
Y freq 40hz
damping factor 0.15
